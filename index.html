            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Email spam detection is a critical application of machine learning in cybersecurity and data science. It involves analyzing the content and metadata of emails to distinguish between spam and legitimate (ham) messages. Spam emails are often associated with phishing attempts, fraudulent schemes, or malware distribution, making their detection essential for protecting users and systems.</p>
            <p>This report demonstrates spam email detection using a machine learning pipeline, featuring a dataset of email messages labeled as spam or ham (legitimate).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="spam-detection">
            <h2>How Spam Detection Works</h2>
            <p>Spam email detection involves the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering a dataset of labeled emails with content and metadata.</li>
                <li><strong>Text Preprocessing:</strong> Cleaning the data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Converting email content into numerical representations using techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) to classify emails as spam or ham.</li>
            </ul>

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("spam_emails.csv")  # Replace with your dataset
print(data.head())

# Preprocess the data
X = data['email_content']  # Email content
y = data['label']  # 1 for spam, 0 for ham

# Split the data
